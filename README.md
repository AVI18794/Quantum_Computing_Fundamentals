# What are Quantum Computers?
Before discussing what are quantum computers let's see what are classical computers.
* Classical Computers:- In classical computer or generally what we call it as computers we store the the information in the form of binary values (either 0 or 1) and we call those buckets which stores the either of the two values as bits.
    So whatever devices we see today are all classical computers and are made of transistors which stores the information in the form of bits or a stream of bits and operations can be performed on it by the manipulation of those bits. There will be only one state of those bits either 0 or 1 at a time.

* Quantum Computer:- Quantum Computers on the other hand are able to exploit the properties of quantum physics(about which we will discuss as we go further) to perform some computations in a different manner.The quantum property of superposition and entanglement to perform computations are much more efficient as compared to the classical ones.


# Uses of Quantum Computers

# Qubits
   * What is a Qubit?
   * How to simulate a qubit?
   * Different notations of qubits.
   * Bloch Sphere
   * Superposition and Measurement of Qubits

* Qubit :- A qubit is a quantum piece of information used in quantum computing that represents one possible combination of two values.Manipulation of qubits or information stored in qubits is what powers the quantum computers.

* In other words a "qubit" is a **quantum equivalent** of the **classical bit** which can be in either 0 or 1 state or it can be in the state of superposition of state 0 and 1.
